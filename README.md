# The Java File
This is The Java File.

The Java File is a Java program.

I don't need to explain how to use Java becuase this is GitHub.

I have added the .class file just in case you need it.

## Releases
I try to release a new version every week until we hit version 1.0, then the scheduele will change.

To view version history and projected future releases, please see the `version.txt` file.

All release code is in `Releases/Release x`, in which `x` is replaced with your version number.

## Betas
I try to release a new beta build 2 or 3 times a week.

Beta history is not in any file, but may be added in the future,

All beta code is in `Betas/Beta x`, in which `x` is replaced with the version number of the version the beta is testing.

Beta naming format goes like this: `bmmddyy`, in which `b` means beta, `mm` is the two digit month number, so July is `07`, `dd` is the two digit day number of the month, so the first day of the month would be `01`, and `yy` is the two digit year number, so 2009 would be `09`. So a beta released on July 1st, 2009 would be titled `b070109`.
